# The 'Procfile' is necessary for Heroku to know how to run the application.
# Heroku cannot start the application without this file. The Procfile indicates the type
# of process to run, in this case, a web server to serve our Django app.

# The following line tells Heroku to use Gunicorn, a WSGI server, to run
# the Django application. Gunicorn is an efficient web server for WSGI-based applications,
# such as Django.

# 'project_image_processing.wsgi' is the path to the Django applicationâ€™s WSGI file,
# which is used to communicate between the web server and the Django application.
# Make sure to replace 'project_image_processing' with the actual name of your project folder
# if it is different.

web: gunicorn project_image_processing.wsgi
